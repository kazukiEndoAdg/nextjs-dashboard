// NOTE: page.tsx
// page.tsx is a special Next.js file that exports a React component, and it's required for the route to be accessible. In your application, you already have a page file: /app/page.tsx - this is the home page associated with the route /.

export default function Page() {
    return <p>Dashboard Page</p>;
  }
